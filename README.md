# Edrivetour-Intermediate-Project

All the necessary files and documents collected for the Intermediate Project of the Edrivetour Erasmus plus programme. The Intermediate project was a necessary part for the certification process and demanded the creation of two OpenSpace3D augmented reality apps plus the 3D modelling of two different vehicles and the collection of their technical data and specifications and the writing of two academic papers. In order to provide transparency of our work in our academic papers we submit all relevant files on this repository.
